David Crystal, a popular linguist, talks about this in the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jISbgvgRTTM" rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Old, Middle, Modern: Chaucer as the turning-point in the story of English pronunciation</a>. His point seems to me to be about how English pronunciation became unhinged from the written word; that’s one of the reasons why it’s so hard to spell in English, and you have to memorise everything, and words rarely sound like they are pronounced.<p>Taking the first four lines of the Canterbury Tales prologue, Crystal first reads with a modern English pronunciation and the rhymes don’t work at all. He then reads it again with a middle English accent and the end rhymes work perfectly. This can appear really odd as the written words often give no real clue as to their pronunciation. To be more specific: <em>licour</em> and <em>flour</em> would not rhyme in modern English, but they do in middle English! Some language do have a high grapheme to phoneme correspondence, and you can see a list on this wikipedia page <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography#Ideal_phonemic_orthography target=_blank>Phonemic Orthography</a>.<p>There is something that can aid us, a phonetic alphabet and it can help make English pronunciation and spelling make a little more sense. Known as the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), it corresponds sounds and letters, phonemes and graphemes. Written at a time before spelling went awry, Adding to that, Chaucer’s poetry in conjunction with the <em>IPA</em> can really help us to build a bridge to Middle English I feel. From the beginning of the Canterbury tales prologue:<div class=verse><p>Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote<br> The droghte of March hath perced to the roote<br> And bathed ever veyne in swich licour<br> Of which vertu engendred is the flour.<br></div><p>Might look like this when written with the <em>IPA</em>.<div class=verse><p>hwαn θɑt april wiθ his ̌su:rəs so:tə<br> θə dru:xt ɔf marč haθ pɛrsəd to: θə ro:tə<br> αnd bα:ðəd ɛvri vɛɪn in swɪč lɪku:r<br> ɔf hwič vɛrtiʊ ɛnjɛndrəd is θə flu:r<br></div><p>Even though, if you haven’t seen the IPA before and perhaps if you have, it may appear a bit like gobbledegook, you can still get a visual taste of the rhyme via the IPA: just look at the last word in each line and see how rhyming pairs of syllables are used, such as <em>tə</em> and <em>tə</em> and then <em>u:r</em> and <em>uːr</em>. By the way, the backwards <em>e</em>, written <em>ə</em> is known as the <em>schwa</em> and is a very common sound in English; It appears in <em>the</em> and <em>her</em>, but you can also get <em>hɜːr</em> which is more like the <em>i</em> sound in the word bird - just to complicate things. So, the IPA is a great tool for deciphering pronunciation, yet it can take a bit of getting used to. Especially, remembering the different sounds and associating them with their IPA letters (graphemes), for which I recommend inventing your own mnemeonics.<p>I hope to dig a little deeper into this fascinating area, perhaps looking at how an event known as the <em>The Great Vowel Shift</em> in conjunction with the invention of the printing press played a major part in disconnecting the sound of the spoken word from it’s written representation, effectively typesetting the old pronunciation in stone. It seems that the written language can be slow in adapting to changes in the spoken word. Maybe this never will change, maybe the IPA is the solution and we will see fairy tales beɡinning <em>wʌns əpɒn ə taɪm</em>.<p>Anyway, getting back to the idea behind this blog post, reading the original Chaucer with what might be close to the original pronunciation is great fun. Understanding the meaning of the words is still a challenge, but a worthy one, and facilitated by the enjoyment of the rhyme. I’ll keep you posted.</section></article></main><div id=button-container><a title="Go to the top of the page" class=no-hover-padding href=# id=top-button> <svg viewbox="0 0 20 20" fill=currentColor><path d="M3.293 9.707a1 1 0 010-1.414l6-6a1 1 0 011.414 0l6 6a1 1 0 01-1.414 1.414L11 5.414V17a1 1 0 11-2 0V5.414L4.707 9.707a1 1 0 01-1.414 0z"/></svg> </a></div><span class=hidden id=copy-success> Copied! </span><span class=hidden id=copy-init> Copy code to clipboard </span><script defer src=http://alexscott.net/js/copyCodeToClipboard.min.js></script></div><footer><section><nav class="socials nav-navs"></nav><nav class=nav-navs></nav><div class=credits><small> Powered by <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://www.getzola.org target=_blank>Zola</a> & <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/welpo/tabi target=_blank>tabi</a> </small></div></section></footer>
