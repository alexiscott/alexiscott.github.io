<h1 class="title">Chaucer and "Found in translation"</h1>
</header><p>
Once upon a time, English pronunciation became unhinged from the written word. But it wasn't always the case, and Chaucer's poetry seems to unveil the original logic in spelling. First I must pay tribute to Geoffrey Chaucer, and secondly to David Crystal for elucidating this for me. <label id='fnr.1' for='fnr-in.1.2283084' class='margin-toggle sidenote-number'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup></label><input type='checkbox' id='fnr-in.1.2283084' class='margin-toggle'><span class='sidenote'><sup class='numeral'>1</sup>

</span>
</p>

<p>
Taking the first four lines of the Canterbury Tales prologue, Crystal first reads with a modern English pronunciation and the rhymes don't work at all. He then reads it again with a middle English accent and the end rhymes work perfectly. This can appear really odd as the written words often give no real clue as to their pronunciation. <i>licour</i> and <i>flour</i> would not rhyme in modern English, but they do in middle English, and it sounds great wonderful.
</p>


<p>
There is something that can aid us, a phonetic alphabet and it can help make English pronunciation and spelling make a little more sense. Known as the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), it corresponds sounds and letters, phonemes and graphemes. Apar from the video that I link to, you can see the sound/spelling relationship here:
</p>

<p>
From Chaucer's Prolougue to The Canterbury Tales:
</p>
<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
Whan that Aprill with his shoures soote<br>
The droghte of March hath perced to the roote<br>
And bathed ever veyne in swich licour<br>
Of which vertu engendred is the flour.<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>


<p>
Might look like this when written with the <i>IPA</i>.
</p>

<div class='verse'><blockquote>
<p class="verse">
hwαn θɑt april wiθ his ̌su:rəs so:tə<br>
θə dru:xt ɔf marč haθ pɛrsəd to: θə ro:tə<br>
αnd bα:ðəd ɛvri vɛɪn in swɪč lɪku:r<br>
ɔf hwič vɛrtiʊ ɛnjɛndrəd is θə flu:r<br>
</p>
</blockquote></div>

<p>
Even though, if you haven't seen the IPA before and perhaps if you have, it may appear a bit like gobbledegook, you can still get a visual taste of the rhyme via the IPA: just look at the last word in each line and see how rhyming pairs of syllables are used, such as <i>tə</i> and <i>tə</i>  and then <i>u:r</i> and <i>uːr</i>.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, something went wrong, and the <i>Great Vowel Shift</i> had a big part to play in that, oh and also the invention of the printing press.
