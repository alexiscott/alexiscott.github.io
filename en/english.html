		<h1>Alex's English Conversation Groups</h1>
		<p>
			These are a great way to work on your English. Sometimes using
			topics that he proposes, or articles that he thinks might be
			of interest. But often, he just goes with what the group finds
			interesting at the time.
		</p>

		<p> Here are a few testimonials from a conversation group that
			he's been working with over the past couple of years:
		</p>

		<p>
			- <i>If you want an interesting and good conversation, spend a while
				talking with Alex, from Armando Galante</i>
		</p>

		<p>

			- <i>Lessons with Alex are brilliant, engaging and covering a wide range of
				topics. He lets you speak without interrupting, only to then explain
				in a very thoughtful way how you should have phrased something or how
				it should be pronounced.</i>

		</p>

		<p>

			<i>They’re really enjoyable; I have a great time just chatting away. It’s
				a dynamic and educational conversation. I love it!</i>
		</p>
